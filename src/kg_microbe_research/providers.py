"""The fleet's single deep-research provider catalogue.

Every Mech previously carried its own copy of this table in
`scripts/deep_research_provider.py`. The five copies agreed on the provider
facts and drifted everywhere else, so this module owns the facts, the status
vocabulary, and the paid-cost boundary, while each Mech keeps its own focus
profile (see `kg_microbe_research.profile`).

No provider is called here and no credential *value* is ever read or printed —
only whether a recognised variable is set.
